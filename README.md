Westech
=======
I am constantly asked to show my work from past experiences I have had. This is from Westech Equipment where I have worked over the last year and a half. I keep learning more and know that I need to learn even more. But here is some of the files and libraries I have had experience with.

Files displayed for samples of my work.
